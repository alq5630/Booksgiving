        <h3>Why She Is Nesryn</h3>
        <p>Alyssa has always had this quiet, confident strength that feels grounding to be around. She never forces her presence and she never tries to be anything except herself, yet she naturally becomes the steady one in every situation. Nesryn has that same energy. She leads by simply existing in her truth, and there is something about that that feels so much like Alyssa.

        Alyssa is incredibly dedicated to the things that matter to her, especially her work with her students. That kind of commitment takes courage, patience, and a really soft heart that cares more deeply than people realize. Nesryn is built the same way. She shows her strength through action rather than performance and she holds a lot of quiet emotion underneath the surface.

        And even though Alyssa has always been the cool girl, she has also had her own path of learning how to let people in and trust that she can be loved in ways she deserves. Nesryn walks that same line between independence and vulnerability. The more she opens her heart, the more powerful she becomes, and that reminds me so much of Alyssa too.</p>

        <h3>The Scene</h3>
        <p>The sunrise aerie moment is Alyssa. Strong and self assured, but softening in a way that feels quiet and brave. She carries both strength and tenderness in the same breath, which is exactly why her match is Nesryn.</p>

<!-- LAUREN — ROT FEYRE -->
<!-- ------------------------------------------------- -->
<section class="character-card">

    <div class="character-header">
        <h2>Rot Feyre</h2>
        <p class="real-name">Lauren</p>

    </div>

    <div class="character-description">
        <h3>Why She Is Rot Feyre</h3>
        <p>Lauren has this incredible blend of wisdom and chaotic fairy energy that no one else carries. She can be in a full spiral, pause for one second, look at herself from above, and laugh because she knows exactly how dramatic she is being. It is self aware, unhinged, funny, spiritual, and somehow grounding all at once. Rot Feyre radiates that energy too. She is beautiful and exhausted, magical and messy, and she is powerful in ways she barely understands.

        Lauren has that old soul depth under the chaos, the kind that shows up in the middle of a joke or a breakdown. Rot Feyre balances softness and rot, humor and devastation, enlightenment and burnout, and that is exactly what makes her match so strong.</p>

        <h3>The Scene</h3>
        <p>The forest ruin moment captures Lauren perfectly. Half divinity, half decay, wandering through the overgrown wild like she owns the place. She looks tired, powerful, irritated, and spiritually awakened all at the same time. It is the exact energy of Lauren explaining her spiritual downloads while eating sugar at midnight.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="character-description">
        <h3>Why She Is Lysandra</h3>
        <p>Ryan has this magnetic, dangerous beauty that makes people stare before they even realize it is happening. She gives everything too fast, loves too deeply, and then turns into a full emotional hurricane when someone betrays her. It is dramatic and loyal and chaotic and honestly iconic. Lysandra has the same intensity. She loves with her whole body and she becomes a storm when she is hurt.

        Ryan also has that party girl wildness that comes from feeling, not from trying to impress anyone. And underneath all of it, she has a soft heart that wants to be loved safely. That is Lysandra at her core. A wild storm with a gentle center.</p>

        <h3>The Scene</h3>
        <p>The candlelit betrayal moment fits Ryan exactly. Beautiful and furious. Hurt but already planning the comeback. Emotional fire glowing under soft, exhausted beauty. This is why she embodies Lysandra so naturally.</p>

    <div class="character-description">
        <h3>Why She Is Elide</h3>
        <p>Jen carries a quiet strength that most people never fully see because she moves through the world with softness. She is a natural healer and she holds other people’s emotions in a way that feels safe. Elide is built from that same energy. Gentle, private, but incredibly strong beneath the surface.

        Jen is also in her own version of Elide’s journey. She is trying to find her way out of a relationship that does not protect her heart, and she hides the truth while she figures out the next steps. Her strength is quiet, but it is real.</p>

        <h3>The Scene</h3>
        <p>The marsh escape moment fits her perfectly. Barefoot, exhausted, scared, yet still walking toward something better. It is survival and softness and quiet determination, which is exactly who Jen is.</p>

    <div class="character-description">
        <h3>Why She Is Morrigan</h3>
        <p>Mary has a warm, bright energy that makes people feel safe. She came from a chaotic past and completely rebuilt her life into something stable and loving. Mor has that same glow. Radiant, maternal, soft, and fierce all at once.

        She turned her past into a foundation for something better. She became someone new, someone proud, someone steady. That is why she matches Mor so beautifully.</p>

        <h3>The Scene</h3>
        <p>The golden sunlight moment fits Mary perfectly. She stands in the life she created for herself. She is glowing, grounded, and full of warmth. It captures the exact energy she carries now.</p>
